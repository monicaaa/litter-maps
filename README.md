# litter-maps
Predicting Philly's litter index with Google Maps Street View.

## Set Up
1. Create an account with the [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/
maps-platform) to gain access to the maps-platform. From there, you should be 
able to access our api key.

2. Copy the api-key into the `api_key.py.template` file and create a copy of the
folder and rename it to `api_key.py`. This file is included in the `.gitignore` file, so there is no need to worry about writing your to git.

3. Run - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
    - This will install all Python dependencies

4. Look for further instructions within Python files.
